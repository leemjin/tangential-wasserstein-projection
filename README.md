Data Availability and Provenance Statements
----------------------------

### Summary of Availability

- [ ] All data used herein are publicly available.

### Details on each Data Source

- For Lego image replication, the data can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joosthazelzet/lego-brick-images. In our repository, select `Lego` in the folder `data`, and the images used are contained therein. We kept the same file names for the files downloaded from the link above.

Datafiles: `data/Lego`

- For Medicaid expansion application, the data can be downloaded from IPUMS: https://usa.ipums.org/usa/. We downloaded the variables stated in the main text: HINSCAID, EMPSTAT, UHRSWORK, INCWAGE. We selected additional technical person-level ID variables to allow us to select household head and spouse (if any). We applied further sample selection criteria mentioned in Appendix B.2 of the accompanying paper.

Computational requirements
---------------------------

### Software Requirements

The simulations and applications were ran using Python/3.8.1.
  - ot (pip install pot) 
  - cvxpy
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - pandas

### Memory and Runtime Requirements

#### Summary

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard (CURRENT YEAR) desktop machine:

- [ ] 3-14 days

#### Details

The code was last run on a **4-core Apple-based laptop with MacOS version 12.4**. 

Portions of the code were last run on a **36-core Intel server with 100 GB of RAM**.  Computation took 8.5 hours. 

  
Description of programs/code
----------------------------

- Programs in `code/01_simulation` will perform simulation studys on all datasets referenced above and output the results in `data/analysis`. The `Dockerfile` in root dictionary will run them all. These programs will generate all tables and plots in the main text.


Instructions to Replicators
---------------------------
- Download the repository to your local computer.
- Install docker desktop using link: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- Open terminal, if you use docker for the first time, type: `docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started`
- Get the container of R 4.1.0 using pull command: `docker pull rocker/r-ver:4.1.0`
- Go to the root dictionary (your local path of the root dictionary) and type: 
  - `docker build -t analysis .`
  - `docker run -v (your local path of the root dictionaryâ€™)/data/analysis:/home/results analysis`

The Rda and txt files will be stored in `data/analysis`

- Go to the dictionary `code/02_analysis` and change the local path in `table_gen.R`. Run the code and get results for tables.

### Details

- `python/01_simulation/archive_functions.R`:

Apart from `.ipynb`, it takes less than 5 minutes to finish running all the programs with 36 cores. `.ipynb` takes 8.5 hours to finish running with 36 cores.

- `code/02_analysis/table_gen.R`: generating the results of all tables
